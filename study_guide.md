- Using Web APIs to work with the DOM
- Understanding event-driven programming for front-end development
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Communicating with the server through XHR and rendering the response to the page
- jQuery (minimal coverage relative to above 4 bullets)

## Concepts

### DOM

- Creating, deleting, cloning, inserting
- Traversing,
- finding
- Element properties vs attributes
- data property

### Events and Asynchronous Programming

- Async mental model, event loop
- `Promises` and `Async/Await`?
- Event object, propagation, default behaviors, delegation, adding/removing listeners
- Page lifecycle

### Ajax

- `HTMLHttpRequest`, events, HTTP methods/headers/body
- Web API, CORS
- `fetch`

### Forms

- de/serializing
- front end validation: html5 vs JS

### JQuery

- Selectors
- jQuery objects, chaining,
- utility methods
- `ajax()`

### Handlebars

- template elements
- compiling, partials
- helpers, expressions

## Project structure

- Modal
  - z-index, capturing click events
- Animation with CSS
  - controlling element visibility
- Saving data in HTML data attributes
- DOM Events
  - element focus, blur, etc
- Code structure and separation of concerns
